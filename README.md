# PWWassessment

Notes along the way:
Noon, 10/6
- Started on whether to decide on creating React/JS app or React/TS app. I chose React/JS app because I have more experience in that stack.
- Look at homepage and structure files based on what components and pages I'm going to need
- Researched the actual site and used Google's dev tools to confirm some of the styling and double checked with the guide because all of it is not the same. Using it for more of a sense of direction.
- Focused first on the main search section with the background image. Done with that at 5:00 (3 hrs of work because I went to lunch shortly after file structuring)
- Going to focus on basis of each section and worry about styling specifics (like typography and margin/padding) at the end
- Check links at the end.
- Taking time but not too much, wanting it to look as close as possible to the guide.
- going to need to conduct research on the dropdowns.
