#Assessment

Notes along the way:
- Started on whether to decide on creating React/JS app or React/TS app. I chose React/JS app because I have more experience in that stack.
- Looked at homepage and structure files based on what components and pages I'm going to need
- Researched the actual site (https://rfa.sc.gov/) and used Google's dev tools to confirm some of the styling and double checked with the guide because all of it is not the same. Using it for more of a sense of direction.
- Focused first on the main search section with the background image and worked my way down. Completed the navbar at the end.
- Going to focus on basis of each section and worry about styling specifics (like typography and margin/padding) at the end
- Check links at the end
- Taking time but not too much, wanting it to look as close as possible to the guide though.
- Conducted research on the dropdowns and transitions.
- Double and triple checked the app to style guide.
- Wrote media queries in the CSS for responsiveness of mobile and tablet devices.
- Deployed Site

What I Would Do Differently Next Time
- I would check out the libraries beforehand for animations or used Tailwind or Bootstrap as the CSS framework, to see if it could have minimized my time.

    I dove right into coding because I knew time was being considered. What took a lot of time for me was styling (padding, margin, and links wise) trying to get it matched up so close with the style guide. I think I maybe stuck to the style guide too strictly. And so next time I think I would have been looser in that.
